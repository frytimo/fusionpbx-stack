To avoid hitting github.com threshold limits clone the freeswitch, sofia-sip, and spandsp before running the build.sh

Use the commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch
git clone https://github.com/freeswitch/sofia-sip
git clone https://github.com/freeswitch/spandsp
```

in the current folder.

This will allow you to recreate/rebuild the images multiple times without hitting github.
